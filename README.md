# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jason

## About Me
I'm a self taught developer who found a love for automating tasks and working with APIs. Anything that makes life a little easier through code. By day, I work in Customer Experience, where I've used Python to solve real problems and automate light tasks. 

Outside of work, I'm a car enthusiast who finds peace on early morning drives through the Bay Area, often with a stop at a local coffee shop (current favorite: â˜• Dr.Ink in Downtown San Jose) It's my way of recharging and getting inspired.

This space is my digital garage, a home for passion projects, experiments, and ideas I'm trying to bring to life as I grow into an engineering role.
